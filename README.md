# Traffic Monitoring System using YOLO

In this project, I developed a C# traffic monitoring application using YOLO (V2, V3, V4) for vehicle detection, tracking, and speed estimation from video feeds. The application is integrated with Alturos.Yolo and features a WPF interface. It stores data in Microsoft SQL Server for further analysis. This project showcases my expertise in machine learning, GUI development, computer vision, and database management.

The main objective was to leverage the YOLO algorithm to create a traffic monitoring system capable of counting cars and calculating their speed. The project involved creating a C# program that utilizes YOLO-V4 to count vehicles of different types on a road from a video stream. The detected vehicles are then saved in a database for future reference. Additionally, I developed a user interface in C# to facilitate interaction and usage of the program.
