# FinalFifthYear
My final project to use Yolo to create a traffic monitoring system that counts cars and calculate thier speed.
discovering Yolo: creating a C# program to count vehicles of different types on a road "from video stream" using YOLO-V4. then saving these vehicles in a database to check them later. after that creating a user-interface in C# to interact and use this program.
